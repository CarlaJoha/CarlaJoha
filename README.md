### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I`m FullStack Development @SoyHenry. Master in Educational Psychology (Universitat de Barcelona). Organizational Structure Consulting. Construction of Training Environments, instruments and products for learning. Fond of creating and editing images and videos.
I have a restless mind, I like to learn new things, that is why I have had a diversity of experiences throughout my life. I was a guide-scout for 11 years, 6 of them, I was in charge of a group of boys, whom I led and planned activities. There I learned about life, life in the open air, about honor, loyalty, tenacity and service; I made close friends, that after many years I still have. While working in education, as a teacher, I discovered music through choral singing, and I sang in a professional choir with which I traveled the world showing versatile music and getting to know first-class settings, cultures, and wonderful people. Fond of photography, I love movies, art, reading, good conversation and food. I have done goldsmithing, catering, as ventures. In recent years, meditation has become an important part of my life, along with what that entails: self-knowledge, mind and body in harmony.
